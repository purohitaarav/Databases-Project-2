Names of all Team members: Shreya Aggarwal (sa1784), Lisa Hamache (lh715), Aarav Purohit(ap2422), Mena Youssef(msy32)
Lisa worked on the initial setup, paramiko, SSH integration, and LLM debugging. Aarav worked on the insert setup and the SQL scripts.Shreya and Mena worked on the README and demo video and the iLab testing.
Some of our challenges included getting paramiko to properly SSH and pass queries with escaping, extracting clean SQL from LLM output, making sure schema info was concise enough for the LLM to handle it correctly, and troubleshooting ilab.
We found phi to be extremely useful when generating correct SQL given any sort of prompt. Paramiko was also a useful tool as it was able to bridge the LLM processing with the remote database. However, it was clear to us that we had trade-offs between the precision of the code and the flexibility, showing how the system handles straightforward queries well. 
Yes we did do the extra credit.
